IntAct parse/load into a neo4j graph
	Web site -> https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/

----------------
Chris' problem definition:

	There is a dataset from embl-ebi called IntAct that contains interactions between proteins.
It can be subset into various groups.

	There are two in particular, one is a virus dataset, and the other a coronoavirus dataset.
It's possible that the latter is a subset of the former, but I'm not sure.
	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/query/annot:%22dataset:virus%22?conversationContext=4
	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/query/annot:%22dataset:coronavirus%22

	I want a gene-gene graph from these sets. For some of the edges, there will be multiple rows representing different
experiments showing the edge

	Please combine into one row. But each row also has a link to an interaction that has one or more pubmeds in it.
I'd like to put those pubmed ids into an array on the edge in the same way that we do for other data sources.  Not sure
if those pmids can be part of the initial data pull or not.

Corona virus data file review
	Data file location -> ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/psi25/datasets/Coronavirus.zip

	This data file is in XML format.

Uses "MI" curies extensivly. MI == "molecular interation"
	MI ontology found at: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/download

The data is laid out in the following XML format:
	http://psidev.info/mif
	ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/psi25/MIF25.xsd

	Entryset (1 per file)
		Entry
			source
			experimentList
			interactorList
			interactionList

Each IntAct entry contains a experiment description that has an associated pubmed id. Sometimes an entry has 1 or more
source pubmed references and/or cross references. Somtimes the UniPortKB IDs are found in the uniref/uniprotkb virus data.

----------------
The data for each coronavirus entry xml node is laid out as follows:

The source XML node:
 - name
 - label
 - xrefs
 - attributes

The experiment xml node:
 - name
 - bibref (numerous pubmeds)
 - host organisms (numerous NCBI taxa)
 - attributes

The Interactors/Interactor Node:
	Interactor XML node:
	 - names (gene name, short name, full name, aliases)
	 - primary xref (primary ref is uniprotkb id)
	 - secondary xrefs (GO, ensembl, uniprotkb, etc.)
	 - type (name, primary and secondary xrefs, etc.)
	 - organism (name, alias, etc.)

Interactions/Interaction relate interactors and also have a number of attributes:
Interaction XML node:
 - name
 - participants (list of interactors in the interaction)
 	- name
 	- interactor reference
 	- biological role
 	- more pubmeds (on biological roles)
 	- host organism (NCBI Taxon)
 - interaction type
 	- name
	- primary and secondary xrefs (curies?)
	- host organism (NCBI taxon)

Parsing the IntAct virus data

Note: The IntAct virus data record will be discarded in the event that both interactors are not UniProtKb IDs

TODO: Intact virus graph node data
TODO: Intact virus graph edge data


----------------
Parsing the cornovirus data (currently not supported)

First parse the interacatorlist xml node to collect all interactors (graph nodes), then parse the interationslist to collect the
relationships (graph edges).

Coronavirus Interactors graph node data

A: Interactor nodes (a pair in each interaction, UniProtKB):
	- id: UniProtKB ID
	- name: UniProtKB ID (no node norm)
	- category: may not node normable, gene|gene_or_gene_product|macromolecular_machine|genomic_entity|molecular_entity|biological_entity|named_thing
	- equivalent identifiers: UniProtKB ID

Other potential nodes
B: Interactor NCBI taxon node (this may not be found in every time):
	- id: NCBI taxon
	- name: NCBI taxon
	- category: node normable, organism_taxon|named_thing|ontology_class
	- equivalent identifiers: node normable, NCBI taxon

C: Interactor gene node:
	- id: gene name
	- name: node normable, gene name synonym
	- category: node normable, gene
	- equivalent identifiers: node normable


Coronavirus Interactions graph edge data
Note: all edge ids are MD5 hash

A - A (gene to gene interaction)
	- relation label: interaction.short_label
	- subject: interactor 1
	- object: interactor 2
	- additonal edge info
		- pubmed reference: bibref.pubmed.id (also the file name)
		- EBI experiment id: experiment.xref.primaryref

other potential edges
