RecQ helicase-Topo III complex,"Required for both the early and late steps of DNA double-strand break (DSB) via dissolution of double Holliday junctions. Early in the repair of a two-ended DSB, the complex contributes to DSB end resection by facilitating the formation of a single-strand 3-prime overhang on which the homologous recombination (HR) factor Rad51 (P25454) filament assembles.

"Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV, COX5B variant","Key role in aerobic respiration, in which mitochondrial enzymes accept electrons from electron carriers reduced in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. A complex metalloprotein that transfers electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and conserves the free energy released in this exergonic reaction by maintaining a transmembrane proton gradient which is utilized to drive the synthesis of ATP or ion transport across the membrane. The four protons consumed in the reduction of one oxygen molecule to water are taken from the mitochondrial matrix and, coupled to this reaction, four additional protons are translocated from the matrix to the intermembrane space. This variant contains subunit 5B, in place of 5a, expression of which is switched on when the O2 concentration drops below a threshold of 0.5 uM O2, and results in a cytochrome-c oxidase which has a higher turnover rate for nitric oxide production.

ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 complex,"Essential for autophagy during nutrient deprivation, a catabolic process that sequesters undesired cellular material into autophagosomes for delivery to lysosomes for degradation.   Functions as an E3-like enzyme in the ATG8 conjugation system. The ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 complex targets the autophagic membrane via the ATG5-ATG16 complex moiety and then recruits an ATG3:ATG8 thioester intermediate via the interaction between ATG3 and ATG12. The ATG12-ATG5 (CPX-1848) conjugate facilitates the transfer reaction of ATG8 from ATG3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) through a reorganization of the catalytic centre of the E2-like enzyme ATG3. The C-terminal glycine of ATG8 is then conjugated to the amine moiety of PE. The role of ATG16, which has no E3-like activity appears to be to target the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate to the autophagic membranes. ATG8-PE/ATG12-ATG5 complexes form homogeneous oligomers, comprising two to four subunits. ATG16 may then act to reorganize ATG8-PE/ATG12-ATG5 oligomers to form a continuous, flat protein layer with meshwork-like architecture on membranes.",4xATG5:4xATG12:4xATG16,Atg16p,YMR159C,unspecified role,4.0,protein,EBI:EBI-2639844,"ATG12 is constitutively conjugated to ATG5, via a glycyl-lysine isopeptide.

U2 snRNP binds to the intron branch site of the commitment complex (CPX-1418) to form the pre-spliceosome in an ATP dependent step.   The spliceosome is a highly dynamic structure, assembled by sequential binding and release of the small nuclear RNAs and protein factors which removes intronic sequence from pre-mRNA. During formation of the activated spliceosome, U2 will replace the dissociating U4 (CPX-31) to form base pairs with U6 (CPX-24). Prior to the first catalytic reaction, the SF3a (CPX-1648) and SF3b (CPX-1647) sub-complexes dissociate from the spliceosome, presumably making the branch site accessible to lariat formation.",BUD13:CUS1:CUS2:HSH155:HSH49:IST3:LEA1:LSR1:MSL1:PML1:PRP11:PRP21:PRP9:RDS3:RSE1:SMB1:SMD1:SMD2:SMD3:SME1:SMX2:SMX3:YSF3,Ysf3p,YNL138W-A,?,?,protein,EBI:EBI-10052103,"U2 snRNP includes several sub-complexes: SF3a (CPX-1648),  SF3b (CPX-1647), RES complex (CPX-1649) and the Sm ring complex.",CPX-26,SGD:S000028509,https://www.yeastgenome.org/complex/CPX-26

DNA-directed RNA polymerase II complex,"Catalyzes the transcription of RNA from a DNA template by acting as a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3-prime end of an RNA transcript. Synthesizes precursors of mRNAs, and most snRNA and microRNAs.   During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the mediator complex (CPX-3226) assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition.",RPB2:RPB3:RPB4:RPB5:RPB7:RPB8:RPB9:RPB10:RPB11:RPC10:RPO21:RPO26,Rpo26p,YPR187W,enzyme,1.0,protein,EBI:EBI-9022447,"Pol II is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other.

Required for the dissociation and recycling of ESCRT-III complex subunits from vesicle and plasma membranes as well as the midbody during the final stages of cytokinesis where it causes constriction of the ESCRT-III polymer and fission of the associated membrane neck. Multiple disassembly reactions are performed until ESCRT-III dissociation has been completed.   VPS4 ATPase activity is regulated by a) ESCRT-III interactions with VPS4 which enhance ATP hydrolysis by relieving autoinhibition of the AAA domain and b) binding of the VTA1 homodimers (Q06263) which both promotes VPS4 oligomerization and enhances ATP hydrolysis. Binding of ESCRT-III subunits DID2 (P69771) or VPS60 (Q03390) to the amino-terminal of VTA1 relieves autoinhibition within VTA1 to further enhance stimulation of VPS4 ATP hydrolysis.

Upon ATP hydrolysis, SSC1 tightly binds the incoming chain and is released from the TIM23 complex. Repeated SSC1-binding cycles drive complete translocation of the precursor protein. SSC1 is finally released upon exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, a reaction stimulated by MGE1 (GRPE). Membrane-bound PAM16-PAM18 (TIM14-TIM16)  regulates the ATPase activity of SSC1. This interaction is stabilised by PAM17 which promotes the PAM16-PAM18 association with the presequence translocase.  ",CPX-539,SGD:S000005984,https://www.yeastgenome.org/complex/CPX-539

Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III,"Key role in aerobic respiration, in which mitochondrial enzymes accept electrons from electron carriers reduced in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle.  Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase pumps protons into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient. This is achieved by oxidizing ubiquinol (ubihydroquinone) which reacts from the membrane phase, reducing cytochrome c in the intermembrane space, and using the free energy change to transport  H+ ions across the membrane from the matrix to the inter membrane space. Quinol oxidation occurs in a bifurcated reaction, in which one electron is transferred to a high potential chain and the other to a low potential chain. The high potential chain, consisting of the iron sulfur protein, cyt c1 and cyt c2, transfers the first electron from quinol to an acceptor (cytochrome oxidase).

Anaphase-Promoting core complex,"APC, a key regulator of cell cycle progression, is a conserved  cullin-RING E3 ubiqutin ligase which facilitates multiubiqutination of cell cycle proteins, including cyclins, so marking them for proteasomal destruction. Generally believed that APC acts as a scaffold that brings E2 enzymes and substrates into close proximity. APC activity is required for metaphase-anaphase transition, mitotic exit, G1 phase and DNA replication. Targets securin for destruction, which is necessary for chromosome segregation. APC seems to have similar function in meiosis.
